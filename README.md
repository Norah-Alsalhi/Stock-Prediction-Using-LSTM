This project focuses on predicting the stock prices of Apple, Google, and Microsoft using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. Historical stock data was retrieved from Yahoo Finance, analyzed, and visualized. LSTM models were then built, trained, and evaluated for each company. The predicted stock prices were compared with the actual prices, and the trained models were saved for future use.
## objective:
To develop and evaluate LSTM models for predicting the stock prices of major technology companies (Apple, Google, and Microsoft) and to compare the performance of these models.

![purple-divider](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7065401/52071927-c1cd7100-2562-11e9-908a-dde91ba14e59.png)

This project focuses on predicting the stock prices of Apple, Google, and Microsoft using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. Historical stock data was retrieved from Yahoo Finance, analyzed, and visualized. LSTM models were then built, trained, and evaluated for each company. The predicted stock prices were compared with the actual prices, and the trained models were saved for future use.
## objective:
To develop and evaluate LSTM models for predicting the stock prices of major technology companies (Apple, Google, and Microsoft) and to compare the performance of these models.
## Steps:
1. **Data Acquisition:**
- Download historical stock data for Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT) from Yahoo Finance.
2. **Data Analysis and Visualization:**
- Analyze the downloaded data to understand trends and patterns.
- Visualize the data using appropriate charts and graphs.
3. **LSTM Model Development:**
- Build LSTM models for each of the three companies.
- Prepare the data for input into the LSTM models.
3. **Model Training:**
- Train the LSTM models using the historical stock data.
3. **Model Evaluation:**
- Evaluate the performance of the trained models by comparing the predicted stock prices with the actual prices.
- Compare the performance of the models between the 3 companies.
Results and Comparison:
- Document the results of the prediction.
- Compare the results between the three companies.
4. **Model Saving:**
- Save the trained LSTM models for future use.
